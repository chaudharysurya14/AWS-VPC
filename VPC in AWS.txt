	NETWORK SETTING
	:select your VPC
	:select your 1st subnet

this process do for all instances for ping


FOR CONNECT THE TERMINAL

	SSH CLIENT
	:copy the example link

GO ON THE TERMINAL
	:go your download path 
	:give execute permission to key pair
	:then paste here the link which u copied

NOW YOU SUCCESSFULLY LOGIN ON TERMINAL PAGE



Q] Create a VPC 192.168.0.0/16 and using this vpc create subnet 192.168.0.0/16 and attach to EC2 instance.Start the EC2 instance and install install tomcat inside it.create your own webpage (message: name and prn no) and host it with help of tomcat serverusing default port 80.
Q] Create a VPC of network 10.10.0.0/16 then create subnet of 10.10.1.0/24 and create subnet2 of 10.10.2.0/24 attach this vpc and subnet to ec2 instance then access both instance and show ip.
